Steps:
1.Building the Network:
Launch Packet Tracer and add the devices (PC, wireless router, cable modem, Cisco.com server, laptop, internet cloud) to the workspace.
Connect the devices using appropriate cables, such as copper straight-through cables for wired connections and coaxial for the internet connection to the cloud.
Ensure that all cables are correctly connected as per the topology diagram.

2.Configuring Network Devices:
Wireless Router: Configure the wireless network (SSID: HomeNetwork), enable DHCP, and set the DNS server to 208.67.220.220.
Laptop: Replace the Ethernet module with the wireless module and connect to the "HomeNetwork."
PC: Configure the PC to use DHCP to receive an IP address from the wireless router.
Cisco.com Server: Configure the server as both a DHCP and DNS server, with specific settings for IP address, subnet mask, and gateway (208.67.220.220).

3.Configuring the Internet Cloud:
Add the necessary modules (PT-CLOUD-NM-1CX and PT-CLOUD-NM-1CFE) to the internet cloud for proper connectivity.
Set the cloudâ€™s configuration to connect the cable modem and the Cisco.com server using copper Ethernet and coaxial cables.

4.Testing Connectivity:
Refresh the PC's IPv4 settings to ensure it receives the correct IP configuration.
Test connectivity by pinging the Cisco.com server from the PC.
