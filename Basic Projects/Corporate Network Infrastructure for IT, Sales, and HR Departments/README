This is a simulated network infrastructure representing a company with three main departments: IT, Sales, and HR. The design ensures that each department operates
within its own local network while maintaining connectivity across the organization and providing access to a local server.

Network Components:
Router (R1):
The central device responsible for interconnecting all department networks and routing traffic between them. 
It acts as the default gateway for each subnet and enables communication between the local network and external resources.

Switches (SW1, SW4, SW3):
Each department is connected to a dedicated switch:
SW1 (IT Department): Connects devices in the 192.168.2.0/24 subnet.
SW4 (Sales Department): Connects devices in the 192.168.4.0/24 subnet.
SW3 (HR Department): Connects devices in the 192.168.3.0/24 subnet.
Server (192.168.1.100):
A local server providing company-specific services. It is accessible internally by all devices on the network through its IP address.
The server hosts a webpage with the message: "This is our server network for you!" External users with knowledge of the serverâ€™s IP address may also access it,
depending on network security rules.

End Devices:
Each department has two PCs assigned static IP addresses within its subnet for communication and resource sharing.

Functionality:
The router ensures internal traffic between departments flows seamlessly and can also connect the network to the internet if configured appropriately.
Each switch isolates department traffic, improving security and performance.
The local server provides centralized resources for the company, such as web hosting or file storage.

Additional Notes:
To enable internet access, the router must be configured with an ISP connection, NAT (Network Address Translation), 
and DNS servers.This setup allows devices to access external web pages like Google while keeping internal communications secure.
This network architecture highlights the basic structure of a company's network, with segmentation by departments, a local server for internal services, 
and the capability to scale and connect to the internet when needed.
