We have two routers, Router1 and Router2, connected via their GigabitEthernet0/0 interfaces. 
We need to configure basic router settings, set a secure password, and observe how Cisco handles password encryption.

----------------------------------

Physically connect Router1 and Router2 using their GigabitEthernet0/0 ports.

Assign custom hostnames to the routers so that Router1 and Router2 can be easily distinguished in the topology.

Configure the privileged mode password on both routers to flower to secure access to enable mode.

Inspect the current running configuration. Can you see the password in plain text?

Activate password encryption on both routers so that plain-text passwords are hidden.

Verify the running configuration again. Is the password now encrypted?

Turn off password encryption for future passwords.

Check the running configuration one more time. Are the previously encrypted passwords still protected?

----------------------------------

Step-by-Step Solution

1. Connect routers

Use a copper straight-through cable between:

Router1 GigabitEthernet0/0 → Router2 GigabitEthernet0/0
Concept: Physical connectivity is needed before configuring IP or testing.

2. Set hostnames

Router1 - CLI
enable
configure terminal
hostname Router1

Router2 - CLI
enable
configure terminal
hostname Router2

3. Set enable password

Router1
enable
configure terminal
enable password flower


Router2
enable
configure terminal
enable password flower

4. View password in running config

CLI
show running-config

Observation:
The password is plain text:
enable password flower

5. Enable password encryption

Router1 & Router2
configure terminal
service password-encryption

Concept: Encrypts all plaintext passwords in running config (Type 7).

6. View running config again

show running-config

Observation:
The password now appears encrypted:
enable password 7 0822455D0A16

7. Disable password encryption

configure terminal
no service password-encryption
Concept: New passwords won’t be encrypted. Existing ones remain encrypted.

8. Check running config

show running-config

Observation:
Password still encrypted.
Concept: Disabling the service does not decrypt existing passwords.
