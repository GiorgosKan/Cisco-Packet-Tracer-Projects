This lab demonstrates how to set up a basic wireless network using a wireless router,
two laptops are configured with wireless network adapters and connect securely to the WiFi network using WPA2 encryption.

Configure a wireless router with SSID and WPA2 security.
Install wireless network modules on laptops (WPC300N).
Connect both laptops to the wireless network.
Test connectivity (ping) between wireless clients.

1 Wireless Router (WRT300N)
2 Laptops

Wireless Router
Network Name (SSID): Office-WiFi
Security Mode: WPA2-Personal
Encryption: AES
Passphrase: StrongPassword123!
---------------------------------------
*Wireless Security Modes*
-WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
Description:
Old encryption method using static keys (64-bit or 128-bit).

Pros:
Compatible with very old devices.

Cons:
Completely insecure.
Breakable in seconds with common tools (aircrack-ng).
Weak encryption algorithm (RC4).

-WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
Description:
Improved security over WEP using TKIP encryption.

Pros:
Better than WEP.
Works with older hardware.

Cons:
Still vulnerable to several attacks.
TKIP is outdated and considered weak today.

-WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II) — RECOMMENDED
Description:
Modern, strong security standard using AES encryption.

Pros:
Strong security.
Widely used and supported.
AES encryption is secure and trusted.

Cons:
Requires relatively newer hardware (but almost all devices support it now).

WPA3 (Newest Standard)

Description:
Strongest modern security standard, resistant to password-guessing attacks. Uses SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) 
for secure key exchange and AES-128 / AES-256 encryption. Enterprise mode can use a 192-bit security suite.

Pros:
Very strong security
Protects against brute-force attacks
Modern encryption (AES + ECC / SAE)
                   
Cons:
Requires new hardware

*Key Differences beetwin Personal & Enterprise*

Authentication:
Personal → everyone uses the same password (PSK)
Enterprise → each user has a unique username/password verified by a RADIUS server

Complexity:
Personal → easy to configure
Enterprise → requires RADIUS server, more configuration

Security:
Enterprise is stronger in environments with many users, because compromising one user does not compromise the network.
---------------------------------
Ensure DHCP Server = Enabled
Default Gateway (router IP): 192.168.1.1
DHCP pool example:
Starting IP: 192.168.1.100
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Packet Tracer laptops do not have WiFi by default.
Click each laptop → Config tab
Remove the default FastEthernet NIC
Add WPC300N Wireless Module
Power the laptop back on

Connect Laptops to WiFi
Laptop → Desktop → PC Wireless
Click Refresh
Select Office-WiFi
Enter the WPA2 password: StrongPassword123!
After connecting, verify that each laptop obtains an IP via DHCP with ipconfig.

-------------

Testing:

Laptop 1: ping 192.168.1.100 
Laptop 2: ping 192.168.1.101 
Both laptops receive IP addresses from the router
Ping between laptops is successful
Wireless network is secured using WPA2
