Scenario
Two routers represent Branch A and Branch B in different buildings.
Branch A LAN: 192.168.10.0/24
Branch B LAN: 192.168.20.0/24

Goal: Enable communication between PCs in different branches using static routing.

Step-by-step configuration

Router A (R1)
conf t

interface g0/0                          # LAN interface
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
end 

interface s0/1/0                        # WAN interface
ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.252
no shutdown
end

ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2  # Static route to Branch B
end
wr #save configuration

Router B (R2)
conf t
interface g0/0                          # LAN interface
ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown

interface s0/1/0                        # WAN interface
ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.252
no shutdown

ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.1  # Static route to Branch A
end
wr

PC Configuration
PC	  IP Address	    Subnet Mask	   Default Gateway
PC-A	192.168.10.10	 255.255.255.0	 192.168.10.1
PC-B	192.168.20.10	 255.255.255.0	 192.168.20.1

Key Concepts
Switch: Connects PCs inside the same LAN.
Router: Connects different networks/branches (default gateway).
Serial port / WAN link: Connects routers in different buildings.
Static route: Manually tells the router where to send packets for a specific network.
HWIC-2T module: Adds Serial ports to routers.
Default gateway: Router interface IP inside the LAN (e.g., 192.168.20.1).
DCE/DTE cable: Needed for Serial links; DCE router provides clock rate - In this lab We use dte so it doesn't need clockrate.

----------------------------

Testing
From PC-A: ping 192.168.20.10 → should reply.
From PC-B: ping 192.168.10.10 → should reply.
Confirms full connectivity between branches.
