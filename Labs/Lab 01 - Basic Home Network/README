Build a small home LAN: 1 router, 1 switch, 3 PCs. Assign static IPv4 addresses, fix link problems, and verify connectivity with ping.

Cable type used: Copper Straight-Through.
Router model: Cisco 1941 (GigabitEthernet0/0 used).
Switch: default Packet Tracer switch (FastEthernet ports).
PCs: Desktop → IP configuration via GUI.

1. Router (Router0)

Open CLI and run:
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
end
write memory

2. PCs (PC0, PC1, PC2)
Configure each PC through Desktop → IP Configuration:
PC0: IP 192.168.1.2 /255.255.255.0, Gateway 192.168.1.1
PC1: IP 192.168.1.3 /255.255.255.0, Gateway 192.168.1.1
PC2: IP 192.168.1.4 /255.255.255.0, Gateway 192.168.1.1

Why we installed HWIC-2T

The Cisco 1941 router had no active interfaces, so it could not accept Ethernet/serial connections.
Installing HWIC-2T enabled additional interface controllers so the router could bring ports online.

What HWIC-2T is

HWIC-2T = High-Speed WAN Interface Card with 2 serial ports.
In Packet Tracer, adding it activates the router’s interfaces so it can be used in basic labs.

Why we use no shutdown

All router interfaces are disabled by default.
no shutdown turns the interface on, changing it from administratively down to up.

Why we use write memory

write memory saves the running configuration to startup-config.
Without it, the router loses all settings after a reboot.

Connectivity Tests

Now that all devices are configured correctly, we verify that the LAN works.
Test 1 — PC0 → PC2
From PC0 Command Prompt:
ping 192.168.1.4
Result: Successful replies → PC0 can reach PC2 through the switch and router interface.

Test 2 — PC1 → Router
From PC1 Command Prompt:
ping 192.168.1.1
Result: Successful replies → PC1 can reach the default gateway (router interface G0/0).
