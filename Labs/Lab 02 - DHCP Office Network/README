Build a small office LAN: 1 router, 1 switch, 4 PCs.
Configure DHCP on the router to assign IP addresses automatically.
Test connectivity between PCs and the router.

Cable type: Copper Straight-Through
Router: Cisco 1941 with HWIC-2T installed
Switch: default Packet Tracer switch
PCs: 4 desktops

DHCP Configuration on Router
Enter router CLI:

enable
configure terminal

ip dhcp pool OFFICE
network 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0
default-router 192.168.10.1
dns-server 8.8.8.8
exit

interface g0/0
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
end
write memory

PC Configuration
On each PC → Desktop → IP Configuration → select DHCP.

PCs will automatically receive:
IPs: 192.168.10.2 – 192.168.10.5
Subnet: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.10.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8

DHCP Process (What Happens When PCs Request an IP)
DHCP Discover
The PC sends a broadcast message on the network looking for a DHCP server.
DHCP Offer
The router (DHCP server) responds with an IP address offer from the pool, along with subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS.
DHCP Request
The PC requests the offered IP address from the DHCP server.
DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK)
The DHCP server confirms the IP assignment and provides full configuration.
PC applies the IP, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS settings.
After this process, the PC can communicate on the network and ping other devices.

DHCP Pool, Default Router, and DNS Explanation

1. DHCP Pool OFFICE
A DHCP pool is a range of IP addresses that the router can assign automatically to devices.
In this lab, OFFICE is the name of the pool.
Any PC configured for DHCP will request an IP from this pool.

2. Default Router
The default router (gateway) is the IP address that PCs use to send traffic outside their local network.
In this lab, 192.168.10.1 is the router interface that acts as the gateway for all office PCs.

3. DNS 8.8.8.8
DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses.
8.8.8.8 is a public Google DNS server.
PCs use it to resolve domain names when accessing the Internet (in future labs with Internet simulated).

Testing Connectivity
Test 1 - PC0 → PC3
ping 192.168.10.5

Should reply → PCs can communicate via switch.
Test 2 - PC1 → Router
ping 192.168.10.1
